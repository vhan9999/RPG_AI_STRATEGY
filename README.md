# RPG AI STRATEGY Game Project

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a strategy game on the PC platform using the Unity3D game engine. The game incorporates artificial intelligence and war simulation elements, with soldiers trained using reinforcement learning techniques. Our research focuses on optimizing intelligent agent behavior through adjustments to rewards, parameters, and methods.

**Project Number:** 113-CSIE-S020  
**Duration:** Semester 1, 2023 to Semester 1, 2024  
**Advisor:** Professor Chuan-Ming Liu

## Project Structure

1. **Game Development:**
   - Implemented using Unity3D
   - Gameplay inspired by strategy games like Battlefield and Total War Simulator

2. **AI Training:**
   - Utilizes ML-Agents for agent creation and training
   - Implements MA-POCA algorithm for multi-agent learning
